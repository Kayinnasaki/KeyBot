# KeyBot
A simple IRC bot designed to send key pressed to games. Useable for "Twitch Plays" type scenarios, though the IRC code is designed for being used on IRC. If you want a dirt-simple bot to build on, this should work. Look for similar bots for how to implement OAUTH for twitch channels. Pretty much all of us are built off of the same random python tutorials and stackexchange threads.
